## Background story
The mobile application helps users wake up before the destination.
Based on my true story when my first month arrived to Canada. I have a big trouble with falling asleep on the bus and skipping the stop many times. 
One of the most important reasons that I came to Canada in the winter time, it was a black and white movie whenever I went out from home, usually at 6 to go to school, it was too dark outside and even when I got back home the sun it's hiding somewhere already. 
From my house to school it takes me 2 hours so I have nothing but sleep on the bus. And without knowing when and where I should wake up, I always skipped the bus and it was a terrible experience for me.
So my dream at that time was something that could wake me up 2km or 3km before the stop.

## Solution
Users can set the destination location and the radius where the alarm should be triggered so that they will fully awake to prepare to get out of the bus

## Purpose
After finishing the journey of IEEEXtreme 17.0 I set my next goal to complete this mobile application. Firstly, to push me to do something because I'm kind of lazy. 
Second, I want to use this project to submit to CS50x as my final project, CS50x it's one of my saviors in the journey of computer science so I really really want to get the certificate to store all of the good memories when I'm learning it
Hopefully, I can learn something on the way to create this application :D

## Figma
This is my simple Figma design for this application
